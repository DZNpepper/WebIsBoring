        <ul><br></br>
            <li><strong>Motherboard</strong> The central circuit board that connects all components together, acting as the communication hub for your PC. It dictates the type and amount of hardware your system can support.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> The primary processor of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and operations. It's paired with cooling solutions like air coolers or liquid coolers to manage the heat it generates during intensive tasks.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Graphics Card (GPU)</strong> Crucial for processing and rendering graphics; it enhances everything from video playback to gaming and professional graphic design. Modern GPUs also support advanced applications like AI processing and 3D modeling.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Memory (RAM)</strong> Vital for system performance, RAM stores data that the CPU needs quick access to. More RAM allows for smoother multitasking and faster data retrieval.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</strong> Provides stable and reliable power to all components. Choosing a high-quality PSU can improve efficiency and protect hardware through better power regulation.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Storage Drives (HDD/SSD)</strong> Critical for data storage. SSDs offer faster data access speeds and durability compared to HDDs, leading to quicker boot times and more responsive applications.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Peripherals</strong> External devices such as monitors, keyboards, mice, and speakers that enhance the interaction with and functionality of the PC. These can significantly impact the user experience, from ergonomic benefits to high-fidelity audio and visual outputs.</li><br></br>
