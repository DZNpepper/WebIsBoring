        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
        <br></br>
        <li><strong>Thermal Management</strong> Choose a case that enhances airflow and cooling efficiency. Features such as fan placements, air filters, and the ability to install additional cooling systems like water cooling are essential to maintain optimal temperatures, especially when overclocking.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Material and Structure</strong> The build material influences the durability and thermal dynamics of your PC. Materials like aluminum offer a lightweight yet sturdy structure, whereas steel is robust and tempered glass panels showcase internal components while offering a modern look.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>GPU Compatibility</strong> Ensure the case can accommodate the size and heat output of your graphics card, particularly if you're planning to install high-end or multiple GPUs. Adequate space for GPU installation and ventilation is crucial for performance and longevity.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Cable Management</strong> Good cable management helps in keeping the build neat and improves air circulation. Look for cases with cable routing holes and enough space behind the motherboard tray to tuck away cables.</li><br></br>
            <li><strong>Expansion Potential</strong> Consider the number of drive bays and expansion slots. A case that offers flexibility for future upgrades, including additional hard drives, SSDs, and expanded PCI slots, is a wise choice for growing needs.</li><br></br>
