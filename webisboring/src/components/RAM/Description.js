            <h2>What is RAM?</h2>
            <p>Ram, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly. RAM is the main memory in a computer and it is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard drive, solid-state drive, or optical drive.</p>
            <h2>Why is RAM Important?</h2>
            <p>RAM is important because it holds the data and instructions that the CPU needs while executing a program. More RAM allows for running multiple applications simultaneously, and for more data to be quickly accessible to the CPU at any time.</p>
