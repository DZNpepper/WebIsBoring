            <h2>What is a PSU?</h2>
            <p>The Power Supply Unit (PSU) in a computer converts the power from the wall outlet into usable power for the other components of the computer. It converts AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.</p>
            <h2>Why is the PSU Important?</h2>
            <p>A reliable PSU is crucial because it provides consistent power to all the components and ensures their stability and longevity. A poor-quality PSU can lead to unstable system performance and premature hardware failure.</p>
